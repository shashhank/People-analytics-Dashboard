My approach to HR metrics provides a comprehensive overview of employee data, helping organizations make informed decisions. It highlights key areas such as hiring trends, employee turnover, and diversity metrics. By visualizing data, it uncovers insights into workforce composition and dynamics. This enables businesses to track performance, identify patterns, and improve HR strategies. With a focus on actionable insights, it bridges data and decision-making.
